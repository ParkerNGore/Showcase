# Showcase

## Objective

    Display knowledge of several technologies I have used daily since January 2020 in a concise and clear manner.
    This will be my go to project for teaching, continued improvement, proof of concepts, and recruiters.
    I want this project to be more of Mock business application with the intent to display practical uses.

## Configuration?

## Local Startup

Show information on how to startup application locally with and without docker.
May or may not include Configuration/Environment Variables?

    ### With Docker

    ### Without Docker

## Azure Deployment

    How to deploy to Azure...

## Feedback

    Feedback is important. Provide instructions on how anyone who stumbles or willingly stumbles on this project can provide feedback.

## Comments?

    I think it would be nice to have some form of "journal" so I can see my own thought process. Something more detailed than commits, but maybe not as extensive as a Kanban Board.
    As a developer how often do you come back to old code and say "What was I doing? What was I thinking".
    Maybe a Kanban Board is the answer... Yea.. TBD.
